## Mobile device management (MDM) for iOS.

Manage Apple iOS devices including iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch and iPad Pro. With iOS enabled MDM, IT administrators can manage both company-owned and BYOD devices without any hassle. Mobile Device Manager Plus supports iOS versions 4.0 and above. 

### Device Enrollment

  * Register devices with over-the-air (OTA) enrollment.
  * Enroll multiple devices for the same user.
  * Authenticate users with one-time passcode or with their Active Directory (AD) credentials. 
  * Automate bulk enrollment with [Apple Configurator](https://www.manageengine.com/mobile-device-management/help/enrollment/enroll_ios_devices_using_apple_configurator.html) or [Apple DEP](https://www.manageengine.com/mobile-device-management/help/enrollment/device_enrollment_program_ios_devices.html).
